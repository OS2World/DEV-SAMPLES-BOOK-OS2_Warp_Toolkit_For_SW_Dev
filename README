                 The OS/2 Warp Toolkit for Software Developers


       This diskette contains the sample programs that accompany the
       text in the book.  Each sample is in it's own directory.  We have
       included the source, compiled .OBJs, makefiles and running
       executables for all samples.  You will also find that we have
       included special files that the book mentions such as output from
       EXEHDR.EXE or from DECODE.EXE.

       In addition you will find the complete source for DECODE.EXE, the
       tool we use to inspect .OBJ and .LIB files throughout the book..

       You can look at the files on the diskette or, if you prefer, you
       can copy them to your hard file.

       As mentioned in the text, these samples are used only to
       illustrate points brought up in the book.  They are not intended
       to teach programming.  They are purposely simple and redundant,
       but should help you understand the material as you read the book.

       Here is a very brief description of the contents of each of the
       directories on this diskette.

       SMP1) Used to create .OBJ for beginning inspection

       SMP2) Shows creation of a library (.LIB) file

       SMP3) Putting a function into a Dynamic Link Library

       SMP4) Creating a Dynamic Link Library without an Import Library

       SMP5) Creating a Dynamic Link Library that contains C Runtime
       functions

       SMP6) Use of FWDSTAMP.EXE to replace functions within a Dynamic
       Link Library

       SMP7) Calling a 32-bit function from a 16-bit program

       SMP8) Calling a 16-bit function from a 32-bit program

       DECODE) The DECODE.EXE tool for inspecting .OBJ and .LIB files
